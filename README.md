## Inspiration

The inspiration behind UpSkill is to create a platform that helps individuals to learn new skills, improve their current skills, and connect with like-minded people to grow their network.

## What it does

UpSkill is an application that allows users to search and connect with their peers based on their interests and skills. Users can interact and message other users on the app and learn from each other by sharing their experiences, knowledge, and skills. Rather than going to a professional service that would be very expensive, users can hone their skills by reaching out to people within their faculty. The platform allows users to mentor others and if a user is interested in another user's portfolio and vice-versa, they can do a skill swap and trade skills to learn from each other!

## How we built it

UpSkill was built using a combination of front-end and back-end technologies. The front-end was built using React.js, and the back-end utilized serverless architecture. The database was created using Firebase Firestore.

## Challenges we ran into

One of the biggest challenges we faced was designing the user interface and experience to ensure that it was both user-friendly and functional. We also faced some technical challenges during the development process, such as integrating the different components of the application and optimizing its performance.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud of the final product that we have created. UpSkill is a robust and user-friendly application that can help people achieve their personal and professional goals. We are also proud of the team's ability to work collaboratively and overcome the challenges we faced during the development process.

## What we learned

Through the development of UpSkill, we learned a lot about web development, software architecture, and project management. We also gained a better understanding of the importance of user experience and the need to continually improve the application to meet the needs of our users.

## What's next for UpSkill

The next steps for UpSkill include expanding the range of skills and groups available on the platform, improving the user experience, and incorporating new features to enhance the learning and networking capabilities of the application.
